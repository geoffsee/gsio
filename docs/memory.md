# GSIO Memory System

The terminal chat keeps a lightweight long‑term memory so it can recall
context from earlier sessions. This document explains how it works, how to
configure it, and what to expect while using the agent.

## Overview

GSIO wraps the `@ai-seemueller-io/llm-memory` package behind an
`unstorage`-backed adapter. When memory is enabled the chat loop:

1. **Recalls** – Before sending your latest prompt, GSIO queries stored
   conversations for relevant summaries and prepends them to the model input.
2. **Memorises** – After the assistant replies, the latest exchange is compressed,
   summarised, and written to storage for future runs.

Only non-empty user/assistant messages are considered. Each entry includes:
summaries, extracted keywords, an importance score, and (for short exchanges)
the raw text.

## Storage

By default GSIO creates a `.gsio-memory/` directory in the current working
directory and mounts Unstorage’s filesystem driver. Every conversation is stored
under the `chat:` prefix. You can safely delete the directory to clear history.

If you prefer a different path, change `memory.storageDir` in the config (see
below) before starting a session.

## Configuration

Run `gsio config` or edit `.gsio-config.json` to control the following settings:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `memory.enabled` | Toggle the memory system on/off (default `true`). |
| `memory.userId` | Logical user identifier written into every entry. Useful if multiple people share the same workspace. |
| `memory.maxEntries` | Upper bound on stored entries. Older/low-importance memories are pruned once the cap is reached (default `500`). |
| `memory.storageDir` | Relative path to the storage root (default `.gsio-memory`). |
| `memory.embeddingModel` | Describes the embedding model you expect to pair with GSIO (e.g. `text-embedding-3-small`). Included in agent instructions and UI to keep you aware of the target embedding space. |

Changes made in the config menu take effect the next time GSIO loads the
configuration (typically on the next keystroke or restart).

## UI Signals

When memory is enabled the chat header shows the current status:

- `Memory: active (model: text-embedding-3-small)` – normal operation.
- `Memory: disabled` – memory switched off in the config.
- `Memory: error: …` – storage or recall failed; check the event log panel
  (`Option/Alt+E` to toggle debug mode or inspect the right-hand log panel)
  for more detail.

Memory events such as `memory_ready`, `memory_recall`, or `memory_memorized`
are also appended to the event log so you can trace when GSIO used stored
context.

## Clearing or Resetting Memory

- **Clear everything:** delete the storage directory (`rm -rf .gsio-memory` by
  default) while GSIO is not running.
- **Disable temporarily:** toggle `memory.enabled` to `false` via
  `gsio config`. Re-enable later to resume storing new conversations.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission errors** – Ensure the configured storage directory is writable.
- **Unexpected content** – Memory stores compressed summaries. If you need raw
  text retention, keep conversations short (under ~500 characters) so they are
  preserved in the `raw` field.
- **Too much recall** – Lower `memory.maxEntries` or raise the similarity
  threshold in code (`src/chat.tsx`) if you want stricter matches.

That’s it! With memory enabled GSIO will steadily build a knowledge base of your
terminal sessions, helping the agent stay consistent across long-running projects.
